# TappedIn

TappedIn is a Spotify-powered, mobile-friendly music guessing game.  
You connect your Spotify Premium account, search for an artist, and try to guess the track while it plays through the Spotify Web Playback SDK.

## Features

- **Artist search** – real-time artist search backed by the Spotify Web API
- **Full-track playback** – plays full tracks from the beginning using the Spotify Web Playback SDK (not just 30s previews)
- **Primary track filtering** – only includes tracks where the artist is the first credited artist and longer than 30 seconds
- **Smart deduplication** – merges duplicates across albums/singles so songs don’t repeat
- **Premium-only access** – wiring of Spotify OAuth to restrict gameplay to Spotify Premium accounts
- **Robust guess matching** – normalized title matching so small differences in punctuation/case don’t break answers
- **Rate-limit aware** – avoids hitting Spotify’s rate limits with batched and cached calls

## Access & Spotify Developer Mode

TappedIn uses a **Spotify Developer application**, and Spotify limits apps in development mode to a small set of test users.

To run this project yourself, you should:

1. Create your own app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Add your local redirect URI (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/callback`) to the app settings.
3. Copy your app's **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the `.env` file.
4. Add the email address of your Spotify account under **Users and Access** for that app.

Requirements:

- A **Spotify Premium** account (for Web Playback SDK support)
- Your own Spotify Developer app with your account added as a test user

> If you're specifically evaluating this project and would prefer to use my dev app instead, contact me and I may be able to add your Spotify email to my test user list.


## How to Play

1. **Sign in**

   - Start the app (see “Running locally” below).
   - Go to `/` and click **“Sign in with Spotify”**.
   - Complete the Spotify OAuth flow (Premium account required).

2. **Search for an artist**

   - Use the search bar on the main page.
   - Start typing an artist name; suggestions appear in real time.
   - Select an artist to fetch their primary tracks (deduplicated, >30s).

3. **Start the guessing game**

   - After selecting an artist, the Guess the Song component appears below the track list.
   - Wait until you see something like **“Player connected”** (Spotify Web Playback SDK ready).

4. **Guess the track**

   - Click **Play** to start the song from the beginning.
   - Type your guess in the input field (auto-suggestions help you complete the title).
   - Press **Enter** or click **Submit Guess**.
   - On a correct guess ✅, click **Next** to move to another track.
   - On a wrong guess ✗, keep trying until you get it or skip.
